## Features and Functionalities

Informix supports a wide range of data types and workloads. It's great at handling:

- Traditional SQL databases
- JSON and other NoSQL formats
- Time-series data (like sensor readings)

It's reliable, secure, and designed to keep running even if something goes wrong. It's also lightweight enough to run in smaller setups, like on edge devices or in embedded systems.

Informix is mostly used by large businesses and industries like:
- Manufacturing
- Telecommunications
- Government

Basically, anyone who needs to collect and manage a lot of data reliably. It's especially useful when data is coming from different sources, in different formats, or from remote locations.

## Business Model and Revenue Generation

- Licensing
- Support services

There are also partnerships with companies that embed Informix in their own solutions, and there's potential for more revenue through cloud offerings.
